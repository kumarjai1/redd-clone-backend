# A Reddit Clone

###### Jai Kumar and Qin Zhu collaborated on building a rest API resembling the app reddit.com. It was built using the Spring framework with Java Web Tokens for authentication.


## Technologies Used
* Spring
* Hibernate
* Junit
* User stories [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2407485)
* Draw.io for ERD diagram

## Approach & Planning
The app was planned and prepared using Pivotal Tracker for user stories and Draw.io for the ERD diagram. Once we had the rough layout and priority for our project deliverables we worked as a pair in implementing the features. Our approach was to start with user authentication and security. When that was completed we moved on to the posts, comments, and user profiles. We were able to complete most of our objectives and integrated our UI code with minor issues.
